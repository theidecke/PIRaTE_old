  This module provides several small vectors over @Double@ values.
  All fields are strict and unpacked, so using these should be
  fairly efficient. Each size of vector is a seperate type. It also
  provides a few vector constants to save you some typing now and
  then.

  The @Vector@ class. All vectors are members of this class,
  and it provides ways to apply functions over vectors.
  Typically this methods aren't used directly; rather, the
  other class instances for each vector are implemented
  in terms of these.

{- |
  Takes the /dot product/ of two vectors [of the same dimension].
  If you remember your highschool linear algebra, the dot product
  of two vectors V and W is equal to |V| * |W| * cos k, where
  |V| is the length of vector V, and k is the minimum angle
  between the two vectors.

vdot :: Vector v => v -> v -> Scalar
vdot v w = vfold (+) $ vzip (*) v w

  Returns the /magnitude/ of a vector (that is, it's length).
  Note that this is always positive or zero (never negative).

vmag v = sqrt $ v `vdot` v

{- |
  Multiply a vector by a scalar. This scales the magnitude
  (length) of the vector, but leaves its length unchanged.
  (Except in the case of a negative scalar, in which case
  the vector's direction is reversed.)

  The operators '|*' and '*|' are identical, just with their
  arguments flipped.

  Adjust a vector so that its length is exactly one. (Or,
  if the vector's length was zero, it stays zero.)

{- |
  Takes the /cross product/ of two [3D] vectors. Again, from highschool
  linear algebra, the cross product of vector V and W is a new vector
  P such that |P| = |V| * |W| * sin k (where k is the minimum angle
  between V and W), and the direction of P is perpendicular to both
  V and W. For example, @vcross 'vector3X' 'vector3Y' = 'vector3Z'@.
  Note also that @vcross w v = negate (vcross v w)@.
